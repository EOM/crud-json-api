Missing Functionality
=====================

Even though this listener is used in real applications, some parts of the JSON API
specification have not yet been implemented. Feel free to submit a PR for the missing
functionality listed below and help work towards a full-featured implementation
of the specification, the effort should be minimal.

The JsonApiListener is currently missing

functionality.

JSON API Sparse Fieldsets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JsonApiListener is currently missing support for
`JSON API Sparse Fieldsets <http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets>`_
